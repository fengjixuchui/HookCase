# Using

To use HookCase (once it's loaded into the kernel) you need to write
an "interpose library" (aka a "hook library") containing hook
functions for the methods you wish to hook.  The syntax is very
similar to that of `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` interpose libraries.
There's a annotated template in
[`HookLibraryTemplate`](HookLibraryTemplate/), and there are more
examples under [`Examples`](Examples/).

Once you have a hook library, you need to set environment variables to
load it into a new process and to determine how it behaves there.

Here are the environment variables that HookCase pays attention to:

* `HC_INSERT_LIBRARY` - Full path to hook library

* `HC_NOKIDS` - Don't effect child processes

* `HC_NO_NUMERICAL_ADDRS` - Disable numerical address naming convention

By default, if HookCase sets hooks in a parent process, it will also
set them in all its child processes.  But if you set `HC_NOKIDS` (to
any value), HookCase only effects the parent process (not its
children).

You'll generally not want to set `HC_NOKIDS`.  These days many
applications use multiple processes, and it's particularly useful to
be able to log activity in child processes at the same time as you do
so in their parent.  But note that, even with `HC_NOKIDS` unset, this
really only works properly on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and up.  The
child processes of Apple applications (like Safari) are often XPC
services, which don't inherit their parent's environment.  HookCase
can keep track of "XPC children", but only on OS X 10.11 and up (not
on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or 10.9 (Mavericks)).

Recent versions of HookCase support creating a patch hook for an
(un-named) method at a particular address in a given module.  (For
more information see
[Hooked_sub_123abc() in the hook library template](HookLibraryTemplate/hook.mm#L912).)
So, for example, creating a patch hook for a function named
"sub_123abc" would (by default) specify that the hook should be
inserted at offset 0x123abc (hexadecimal notation) in the module.  But
this convention prevents you from creating a patch hook for a method
that's actually named "sub_123abc" (in its module's symbol table).  To
do so, you'll need turn off this behavior by setting the
`HC_NO_NUMERICAL_ADDRS` environment variable.

HookCase now supports dynamically adding patch hooks for raw function
pointers. This is useful in hooks for methods that use callbacks --
for example CFMachPortCreate() and CFRunLoopObserverCreate(). It's
best to patch callbacks in their "create" methods, before they start
being used. Otherwise there's some danger of a race condition,
especially if the callback can be used on different threads from the
one that calls add_patch_hook(). For more information see
[dynamic_patch_example() in the hook library template](HookLibraryTemplate/hook.mm#L873)
and [the dynamic patch hooks example](examples-dynamic-hooking.md).

HookCase now supports watchpoints. You can set a watchpoint on a range
of memory and get information on the code that writes to it -- for
example a stack trace of the write operation and the id of the thread
on which it ran. This is useful for reverse engineering the use of
certain buffers in memory, for example the "sideband buffer" that's
used by OpenGL accelerated graphics. For more information see
[config_watcher() in the hook library template](HookLibraryTemplate/hook.mm#L793),
[Hooked_watcher_example() in the hook library template](HookLibraryTemplate/hook.mm#L929)
and [the watchpoints example](examples-watchpoints.md).
